PacePilot is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

It's my first project using TypeScript and Bootstrap.

PacePilot helps you create a personalized half marathon training plan. You can provide feedback on each training session, receive weekly badges, and get daily weather updates for your current location!
